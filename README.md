# Bus Mall Project

I created webpage that allows the user to select a favorite item from 3 randomly displayed items. After each selection, the list refreshes with 3 new items, for a total of 25 selections. This website tracks the selections made and displays a list report and a chart of the times an item was clicked verses how many times it was shown. The data collected persistently tracks total views and times shown between  page refreshes.

### Reflections and Comments
* As I worked on this lab, JavaScript really began to click for me. I was able to better understand how everything connected within my JavaScript code. I got quicker at styling my site with CSS as well and more proficient in creating elements through JavaScript.
